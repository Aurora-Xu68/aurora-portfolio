    "description": "Hi, I am Aurora Xu, a student of master degree in Human Resources and Business Analytics at UNSW. I am fascinated by how people, data, and strategy can come together to make work more meaningful. Along the way, I have supported recruitment and HRBP projects, which sparked my curiosity about the future of HR — how we can combine empathy and analytics to help both people and organizations grow. I am now exploring human capital consulting, where I hope to keep blending human insight with data thinking to create workplaces that are smarter, fairer, and more human.",
